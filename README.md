# WebUI

POC demonstration of a web-based management system, containing the following -

* XML services used to connect between front-end/back-end & MySQL as a DB.
* Front-end provided by Play! framework, and angularJS

** And a good excuse to learn a little bit of scala -- which is why the code sucks :)
